# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_ML


first of all we have imported all the dependencies so we have imported numpy for making empire
respondus for creating the data frame and we have the standard scalar function to stabilize the data and then we add a train test split to split our data into training and test data and we have imported the support vector machine model from scalan and then we have uh imported this accuracy score for finding the uh you know for basically evaluating our model then we have loaded our data set which is which was in a csv file to a pandas data frame and we have named the data frame two diabetes dataset so once we add that we just try to see the first five rows to understand about the data in this data set and then we have found the number of rows and columns in this data set and we have found some statistical measures like mean standard deviation percentage etc okay then we have counted the number of values for diabetic cases and non-diabetic cases and here the label 0 represents the person with who doesn't have diabetes and one represents those who have diabetes okay so and then we have grouped the data based on 0 and 1. so we have found the mean values for patients with diabetes and non-diabetes okay so we found that there was a difference in their glucose level so basically the glucose level is more for the patient with diabetes and the age is also more for people who have diabetes so it's one of the important insights we get from this data and then we have splitted the data and the labels separately and the one of the most important step we have done is standardizing all these data because all these data was in different uh range so we have started raise the data to have a common range between them so once we have standardized the data we have splitter the data into training data and test data so we took 20 percentage of our data's test data and then we have uh loaded our model support vector machine classifier into the variable classifier and we have trained our machine learning model with the help of xtrain and the their respective labels python so once we obtain the model we have found the accuracy score on both the training data and the test data once we have a good accuracy score we made a predictive system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of this input data okay so in this we have reshaped the array to tell the machine learning model that we are just trying to predict the output of
only one instance and then we try to print this prediction and uh we just you know make a simple if statement that if this label is one we need to print that the person is diabetic if the label is zero then the person isnon-diabetic
